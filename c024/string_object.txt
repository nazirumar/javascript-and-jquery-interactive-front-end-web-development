WORKING WITH STRINGS




    string object's methods shown on the previous page.
        1. This example starts by storing the phrase “Home sweet home “in a
        variable called saying.
        2. The next line tells you how many characters are in the string using
        the length property of the String object and stores the result in a
        variable called msg.
        3. This is followed by examples showing several of the String
        object's methods.
        The name of the variable (saying) is followed by a dot, then the
        property or method that is being demonstrated (in the same way that
        the other objects in this chapter used the dot notation to indicate a
        property or method of an object).
        4. The final two lines select the element with an id attribute whose
        value is info and then add the value of the msg variable inside that
        element.
        (Remember, security issues with using the innerHTML property are
        discussed on p228.)
