CREATING AN OBJECT: CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION

    The new keyword and the object constructor create
    a blank object. You can then add properties and
    methods to the object.
    First, you create a new object using a combination of the new keyword
    and the Object() constructor function. (This function is part of the
    JavaScript language and is used to create objects.)
    Next, having created the blank object, you can add properties and
    methods to it using dot notation. Each statement that adds a property or
    method should end with a semicolon.
