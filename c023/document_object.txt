USING THE DOCUMENT OBJECT
    This example gets information about the page, and then adds that
    information to the footer.
    1. The details about the page are collected from properties of the
    document object.
    These details are stored inside a variable called msg, along with HTML
    markup to display the information. Again, the += operator adds the
    new value onto the existing content of the msg variable.
    2. You have seen the document object's getElementById() method in
    several examples so far. It selects an element from the page using the
    value of its id attribute. You will see this method in more depth on
    p195.
