BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS


                This example combines several techniques that you have seen throughout this chapter.
                You can see the code for this example on the next two pages. Single line
                comments are used to describe what each section of the code does.
                To start, three variables are created that store information that is used in
                the welcome message. These variables are then concatenated (joined
                together) to create the full message the user sees.
                The next part of the example demonstrates how basic math is performed
                on numbers to calculate the cost of a sign.
                A variable called sign holds the text the sign will show.
                A property called length is used to determine how many characters
                are in the string (you will meet this property on p128).
                The cost of the sign (the subtotal) is calculated by multiplying the
                number of tiles by the cost of each one.
                The grand total is created by adding $7 for shipping.
                Finally, the information is written into the page by selecting elements and
                then replacing the content of that element (using a technique you meet
                fully in Chapter 5). It selects elements from the HTML page using the
                value of their id attributes and then updates the text inside those elements.
                Once you have worked your way through this example, you should have a
                good basic understanding of how data is stored in variables and how to
                perform basic operations with the data in those variables.
