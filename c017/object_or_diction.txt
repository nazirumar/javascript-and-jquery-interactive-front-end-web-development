WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
    Objects group together a set of variables and
    functions to create a model of a something you
    would recognize from the real world. In an object,
    variables and functions take on new names.
    IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME
    KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
    If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property. Properties tell us
    about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it
    has. Each individual hotel might have a different name and a different
    number of rooms.
    IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME
    KNOWN AS METHODS
    If a function is part of an object, it is called a method. Methods represent
    tasks that are associated with the object. For example, you can check how
    many rooms are available by subtracting the number of booked rooms
    from the total number of rooms.
    This object represents a hotel. It has five properties
    and one method. The object is in curly braces. It is
    stored in a variable called hotel.
    Like variables and named functions, properties and methods have a name
    and a value. In an object, that name is called a key.
    An object cannot have two keys with the same name. This is because keys
    are used to access their corresponding values.
    The value of a property can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or even
    another object. The value of a method is always a function.
